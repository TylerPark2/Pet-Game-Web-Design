2. Core Game Features
2.1. Core Gameplay Loop
   1. Select and Name Pet
   * Player selects one of 3 pre-designed dog breeds (e.g., Golden Retriever, Beagle, Cocker Spaniel)
   * Input a custom name for their dog.
   * The player cannot change the breed after the initial choice. The name can be changed anytime via a settings menu.
   2. Pet Care Actions
   * Petting: Players interact with the pet by clicking or tapping on the dog, causing the dog to respond positively, increasing affection.
   * Feeding: Players feed the pet using a variety of food options, contributing affection.
   * Bathing: Players need to wash the dog, requiring multiple simple interactive steps, e.g., clicking on the soap and water to simulate washing.
   3. Affection Meter Progression
   * The main goal is to raise the pet’s affection level from 0 to 10 by completing care actions.
   * Each completed action (petting, feeding, bathing) contributes 50 affection points.
   * The affection meter requires progressively more affection points to level up as it reaches higher levels (e.g., level 1 requires 50 points, level 2 requires 100 points, etc.).
   * Once the pet reaches level 10, it is considered “maxed out,” unlocking the option to select new pets.
   4. Unlock New Pets
   * After maxing out the first pet’s affection level, the player unlocks the ability to select new pets.
   * These pets could be new dog breeds or even other types of animals (e.g., cats, bunnies) as the player continues progressing.
2.2. Secondary Gameplay Features
   1. Minigames & Currency System
   * Minigames (Optional, for bonus affection points or currency):
   * Fetch: A simple game where the player throws a ball, and the dog fetches it.
   * Trick Training: Teach the dog simple tricks like sit, roll over, etc.
   * Chase: A running game where the dog follows a moving object or target.
   * Currency (optional):
   * Players can earn coins through minigames or caring for their pet.
   * Coins can be used for buying cosmetic items or pet accessories (e.g., new collars, toys, etc.).
   2. In-game Shop (optional):
   * Players can spend earned currency on cosmetics and accessories for their pet or their virtual environment.

Inspiration/References
Duck Life
            * Very similar concept, has minigames to raise stats (although this game’s stats are different)
Pokémon XY Bottom Screen Functions/Pokémon Refresh
            * My main and favorite inspiration. There are different types of minigames, and Refresh is the biggest one. You can cook or earn food things (I forgot the name) to feed your pokemon
Tamagotchi
